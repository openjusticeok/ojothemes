# ojothemes

This package contains OK Policy branded themes for `{ggplot2}` plots and `{gt}` tables. There are currently three different looks available: 

- `"okpi"` is our default OK Policy branding,
- `"ojo"` is for the defunct Open Justice Oklahoma branding, and
- `"tok"` is for the Together Oklahoma theme.
